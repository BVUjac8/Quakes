### General Info
***
A predictive analysis of earthquakes near Mt. Fuji was determining the correlation between earthquakes and volcanic eruptions based off of factors of an earthquake (depth, magnitude, and lattitude & longitude).

Collaboration can be made to make this more of a predictive analysis instead of a data analysis or research project.
### FAQs
***
1. **Why is this predictive analysis of earthquakes near Mt. Fuji important to perform?**
_Mt. Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan and an active volcano; the H≈çei eruption of 1707
has an assumption of a correlated relationship between earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. A
predictive analysis will be performed to determine what factors from seismic activity could cause
a potential catastrophic natural disaster (i.e. volcanic eruption) to chance in the country of Japan._
